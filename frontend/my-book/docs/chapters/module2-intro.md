# Module 2: Introduction to Digital Twin Technology

## What is a Digital Twin?

A **Digital Twin** is a virtual replica of a physical system that mirrors its behavior, state, and properties in real-time. In robotics, digital twins enable safe testing, validation, and training without risking physical hardware.

## Benefits of Digital Twins

### Cost Reduction
- Test algorithms without physical prototypes
- Iterate designs quickly
- Reduce hardware wear and tear

### Safety
- Validate dangerous scenarios
- Test edge cases
- Train AI in controlled environments

### Scalability
- Simulate fleets of robots
- Test multi-robot coordination
- Parallel experimentation

## Simulation Platforms

### Gazebo
Open-source 3D robot simulator with accurate physics, sensors, and ROS 2 integration.

### Unity
Game engine adapted for robotics simulation, offering photorealistic rendering and ML-Agents integration.

### NVIDIA Isaac Sim
GPU-accelerated simulation built on Omniverse, designed for AI and robotics.

## Key Concepts

### Physics Engines
Simulate real-world physics: gravity, friction, collisions, joint dynamics.

### Sensor Simulation
Replicate camera, LiDAR, IMU, and other sensor data with realistic noise.

### Sim-to-Real Transfer
Techniques to bridge the "reality gap" between simulation and physical deployment.

Next chapters will dive deep into Gazebo and Unity implementations.
